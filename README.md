## How to Run

### üß† Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- MongoDB installed locally
- `mongosh` for shell interaction
- Git

### üì¶ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scanner-less-biller.git
cd scanner-less-biller

üêç Create Virtual Environment & Install Requirements
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

‚öôÔ∏è Set Up MongoDB Replica Set
MongoDB must be in replica set mode to allow transactions.

Stop any existing MongoDB service:
sudo systemctl stop mongod

Start a single-node replica set manually:
mongod --dbpath /data/db --replSet "rs0"


Make sure /data/db exists or create it with sudo mkdir -p /data/db

Open a new terminal and initiate replica set:
mongosh

Then inside mongosh:

rs.initiate()

You should see: "ok" : 1 in the result.

Optionally, check replica set status:

rs.status()

Now your MongoDB is replica-set enabled.

üöÄ Run the App
python app2.py

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.
